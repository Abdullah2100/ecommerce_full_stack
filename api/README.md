This is fantastic\! Having the API endpoints (from your Swagger/OAS images) and the technology stack (from your `.csproj` file) makes generating a highly effective **`README.md`** much easier.

Since this is a comprehensive API project, I'll generate a detailed `README.md` using the structure I previously recommended.
